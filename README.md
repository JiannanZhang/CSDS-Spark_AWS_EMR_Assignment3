# CSDS-Spark_AWS_EMR_Assignment3

In this assignment, you will be running the same recommendation system that you built for AudioScrobbler Data but on a 3 node AWS-EMR cluster this time.


##Setup

We will first see how to set up a 3 node [AWS - ELastic Map Reduce cluster with Spark](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-spark-launch.html) installed on it. To follow along, make sure you have a functioning AWS account. Also, this service offered by AWS is chargeable. Do not keep you cluster running at all times and remember to keep checking your AWS bill under the Billing and Cost Management option.

AWS offers an easy to use dashboard for creating and launching a cluster and submitting a Spark job to it. Begin by clicking on EMR from the list of services offered on your AWS dashboard. Then click on Create Cluster and you will be directed to this page:
